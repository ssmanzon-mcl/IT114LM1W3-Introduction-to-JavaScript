// Checkpoint 3.1 How would you compare lists in python vs arrays in JavaScript
// Answer: 
// Python Lists: Can contain elements of different data types, and the type of the list can change dynamically.
// JavaScript Arrays: Can also contain elements of different data types, but JavaScript itself is dynamically typed, so the type of the array can change dynamically.
